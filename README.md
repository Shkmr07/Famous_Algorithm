# Famous Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is a collection of famous algorithms implemented in various programming languages. It serves as a reference guide for those looking to understand the logic and implementation of these algorithms.

## Contents

The repository contains the following algorithms:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Search algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic programming algorithms (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
- And many more...

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own directory and includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm, its time complexity, and a code implementation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an algorithm that's not in this repository, feel free to make a pull request.
